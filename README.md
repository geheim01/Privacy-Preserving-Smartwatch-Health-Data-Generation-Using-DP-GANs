# Privacy-Preserving Smartwatch Health Data Generation Using DP-GANs

This repository contains the code and documentation for a research project on generating synthetic smartwatch health data while preserving the privacy of the original data owners. The project uses a combination of differential privacy and generative adversarial networks (DP-GANs) to create synthetic data that closely resembles the original data in terms of statistical properties and data distributions.

## Background

Smartwatch health data has become an increasingly popular source of information for healthcare research and personalized medicine. However, the use of such data raises concerns about privacy, as the data often contains sensitive information about individuals' health and fitness. In this project, we aim to address these privacy concerns by generating synthetic health data that can be used in research and analysis while protecting the privacy of the original data owners.

Our approach uses a combination of differential privacy and generative adversarial networks (GANs). DP-GANs have been shown to be effective at generating synthetic data while preserving privacy, as they introduce random noise into the training process to ensure that individual data points cannot be linked back to specific individuals.
